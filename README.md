## Overview

This page is responsive: the image adapts its size to the size of the window, always being centered. If the size of the window gets to small, the image does not compete space with the login area and desapears on the screen.

The small details on the inputs are alse there. So when you focus on the inputs, the placeholder shrinks to the top. The login button is disabled until the user puts a username and a passoword of eight characters, at minimum.
